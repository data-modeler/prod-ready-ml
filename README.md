prod_ready_ml
==============================

An architecture for machine learning projects that uses databases for training and model storage.

## Objective
The goal of the project is to develop a pattern of training directly from a database (which should often help with memory consumption as it will not need to hold all of the training and validation data in memory). Further, it captures and stores all of the training configuration for ease of recreation, say, for production.

## The model
Although this project is more about developing an architecture and pattern for production-ready machine learning, the data and model are based upon the [Twitter hate speech training dataset found at Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech).
